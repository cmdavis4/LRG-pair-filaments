# LRG-pair-filaments

This repository holds the code developed at University of Pennsylvania by Charles Davis, Andrew Neil, and Alan Meert,

##Project Goals
The project seeks to make a map of neighbor galaxies surrounding LRG pairs in the SDSS. The goal is to use this information to learn about the structure of the dark matter filaments that exist between these pairs as well as the environment surrounding the pairs.
